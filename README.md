# Linux config with a focus on Sway

This has begun to expand to hold all of my Linux configs such as my .vimrc, my sway config files and soem associated bash scripts. Full disclaimer, the history of these files will be disgusting.

## Lessons learnt

* used ln for the first time to add files in different directories to a git repo. (read into inodes and how the Linux filesystem works)
* learning to use grep and sed to get output and transform it to display on swaybar
