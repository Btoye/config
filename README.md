# Linux config with a focus on Sway
My Linux configuration patchworked together from ideas I liked from other people's.

## Goal
My goal in creating my own config is to stay as close as I can to default while not hindering my ability to work productively within a Linux environment. This should also give me the ability to learn some Bash and some more about Linux.

### Lessons learnt
* used ln for the first time to add files in different directories to a git repo. (read into inodes and how the Linux filesystem works)
* learning to use grep and sed to get output and transform it to display on swaybar (learn about awk and how I could make this more efficient)
* used awk to match a line in output and print some of the arguments in different order
