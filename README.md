# Linux config with a focus on Sway

As part of learning sway it was necessary to try and configure it to fit my workspace.. Don't check the commit history, likely a lot of copy paste and mess will turn up.

## Lessons learnt

* used ln for the first time to add files in different directories to a git repo. (read into inodes and how the Linux filesystem works)
* learning to use grep and sed to get output and transform it to display on swaybar
